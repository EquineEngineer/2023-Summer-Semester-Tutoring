## What is a Map?

- An object that stores key-value pairs
- Can find values quickly given a key
- Can add new key-values quickly

## Why do we care?

- Nearly every programming language has some sort of map data structure
- Because of their efficiency, maps are very commonly used
- Objects in JS are maps
- Maps have different names in different languages

## Example Problems

- Cache implementation
- Structuring data
- Communicating with servers (JSON)
